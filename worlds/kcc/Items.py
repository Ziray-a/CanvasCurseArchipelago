# So the goal here is to have a catalog of all the items in your game
# To correctly generate a games items they need to be bundled in a list
# A list in programming terms is anything in square brackets [] to put it simply

# When a list is described its described as a list of x where x is the type of variable within it
# IE: ["apple", "pear", "grape"] is a list of strings (anything inside "" OR '' are considered strings)
